 *
 *          Upon success, the path to the JLinkARM shared library is stored in 'buffer' as a 0-terminated UTF-8 string,

 *          size needed. The size of 'bytes_copied' includes 0-terminator.
 *

 *          Similarly, on Linux, the default install location "/opt/SEGGER/JLink/" is checked.

 * @brief   Connects to a given emulator/debugger
 *
 * @details Connect to an emulator over IP. The target emulator can be specified either by hostname and port, OR by serial number.
 *          When a hostname is provided, the serial number argument is ignored.
 *
 *          The hostname c-string can be an IPv4 address or hostname. IPv6 is currently not supported. The hostname can
 *          also be used to connect to a JLink emulator that is connected in tunnel mode. Example of hostname strings:
 *          IPv4: "192.168.0.1" Hostname: "myserver.com", "localhost" Tunnel:
 *          "tunnel:123456789:test:jlink-europe.segger.com"
 *
 *          In the tunnel example above a devkit with serial number '123456789' is connected to the official
 *          jlink-europe.segger.com tunnel server using the J-Link remote Server application with password "test". Read
 *          more about JLink Remote Server here https://wiki.segger.com/J-Link_Remote_Server .
 *
 *          If a serial number is passed while hostname is NULL, the serial number will be looked for in a list of JLink
 *          emulators that has been discovered on the network. Note that not all network sessions are discoverable.
 *          Generally, debug probes with built in Ethernet/Wi-Fi support are automatically discoverable, but sessions
 *          created through the JLink Remote Server application are not. The list of discovered network debuggers can be
 *          retrieved using function NRFJPROG_enum_emu_con_info().
 *
 *          Not specifying hostname nor serial number will result in a pop-up window appearing for the user to make a
 *          selection. This is done by passing NULL for 'ip' and NRFJPROG_INVALID_EMU_SNR for 'serial_number'.
