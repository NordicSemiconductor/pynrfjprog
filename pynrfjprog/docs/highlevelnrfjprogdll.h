 *          search result, and not which JLinkARM library is in use. See function NRFJPROG_get_jlink_path() for the
 *          latter.
 *
 *          Upon success, the path to the JLinkARM shared library is stored in 'buffer' as a 0-terminated UTF-8 string,
 *          and bytes_copied is updated accordingly. If buffer and buffer_size was passed as NULL and zero, bytes_copied
 *          is set to the total size needed to store the returned JLinkARM path. This can be used to find the buffer
 *          size needed. The size of 'bytes_copied' includes 0-terminator.
 *
 *          The search strategy chosen is dependent on platform. On Windows, Windows Registry is searched.
 *          On OSX the default install location "/Applications/SEGGER/JLink/" is scanned for shared library files.
 *          Similarly, on Linux, the default install location "/opt/SEGGER/JLink/" is checked.
 *          On unix-like systems the function might also return a library name compatible with dlopen if no library file
 *          is found in the default search path.
 *
