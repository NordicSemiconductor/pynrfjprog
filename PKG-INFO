# pynrfjprog
Python wrapper around the nrfjprog dynamic link libraries (DLL). Use of this API allows developers to program/debug nRF SOC and SIP devices from the interpreter, write simple scripts for a more efficient development work flow, or write automated test frameworks. It can also be used to create applications in Python (i.e. command-line tools).

## Use-cases
*  Maximizing development efficiency: i.e. a script to perform various operations every time an application is built and run (could be hooked into a Makefile or automated build system etc...).
*  Automated testing: [Testing Production Programming tools on nRF5 using pynrfjprog](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrf52-production-programming/blob/master/tests/example_test_script.py).

## Dependencies
```python
"""
Detailed below is how our software is stacked. Each layer depends on the layer below.
"""
pynrfjprog  # Imports and wraps the nrfjprog DLL in Python.
nrfjprogdll # A DLL that wraps SEGGER's JLink API for nRF5 devices.
JLinkARMDLL # A DLL provided by SEGGER that works with SEGGER debuggers. Performs all low level operations with target device.
```

* [J-Link Software and Documentation Pack](https://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html) will install the JLink libraries pynrfjprog depends on in the correct installation directory.
* The nrfjprog libraries are installed with pynrfjprog and are included in pynrfjprog/OPERATING_SYSTEM/.

## Getting started
To install the latest release from PyPI:
```
pip install pynrfjprog
```
To install from source:
```
python -m pip install path_to_unzipped_pynrfjprog
```
Open the Python interpreter and connect nRF device to PC:
```
from pynrfjprog import LowLevel

with LowLevel.API('NRF52') as api:
    api.enum_emu_snr()
    api.connect_to_emu_without_snr()
    api.erase_all()
    api.write_u32(ADDRESS, DATA, IS_FLASH)
    api.disconnect_from_emu()
```

To work with multiple nRF devices at once:
```
import LowLevel

api = LowLevel.API('NRF52')
api.open()

api2 = LowLevel.API('NRF52')
api2.open()

api3 = LowLevel.API('NRF51')
api3.open()

api.close()
api2.close()
api3.close()
```

To program hex files using the HighLevel API:
```
from pynrfjprog import HighLevel

with HighLevel.API() as api:
    snrs = api.get_connected_probes()

    # To program J-Link probe at snr <snr>:
    with HighLevel.DebugProbe(api, <snr>) as probe:
        probe.program(<hex_file>)

    # To program MCUBoot target at serial port <serial>:
    with HighLevel.MCUBootDFUProbe(api, <serial>) as probe:
        probe.program(<hex_file>)

    # To update LTE modem connected to J-Link probe at snr <snr>:
    with HighLevel.IPCDFUProbe(api, <snr>, HighLevel.CoProcessor.CP_MODEM) as probe:
        probe.program(<zip_file>, HighLevel.ProgramOptions(verify = HighLevel.VerifyAction.VERIFY_HASH))
```
Note: Only one HighLevel API can be instantiated and opened at a time. Several HighLevel probes can be opened from the same API at the same time.
